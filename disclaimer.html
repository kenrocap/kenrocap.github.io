All individuals and entities affiliated to Kenro are intended third-party beneficiaries of these terms. Our rights under these terms may be waived by us only in writing. These terms are binding on you as well as your successors and permitted assigns. In the event any provision of these terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed severed from the remainder of these terms and replaced with a valid and enforceable provision as similar in intent as reasonably possible to the provision so severed, and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of these terms.

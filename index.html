            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Piyush spent 17 years in technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank, Piyush had a
              deep
              understanding of technology companies and various exit mechanisms such as IPOs, M&A and Direct
              Secondaries.

            <p>
              Continuing in this role as Head of Strategic Development at region’s largest VC firm, Sequoia India/ Peak
              XV for over 7
              years, he saw the growing disparity between the growth of primary investments in venture capital in India
              and SEA vs the
              monetization of their stakes even well into the maturity stage of the company. With M&A exits scarce, the
              IPO bar high
              and a paucity of focused secondary funds, he came out of Peak XV to launch the direct secondaries strategy
              under Kenro
              Capital.

        <p>
          Secondaries investing opportunity is a derivative of the primary investment category. Venture capital went
          mainstream in
          India in mid 2000’s and has developed strongly over the last 20 years. In the 10 years between 2008 and 2017,
          based on
          PitchBook and Tracxn data, an estimated $60B+ was invested in venture capital across India and Southeast Asia
          at
          an
          annual average of $6B. Both entrepreneurship and number of VC funds grew in tandem explosively after and
          between
          2018
          and 2024, an additional $200B was invested, at an annual average of $35B.
        </p>
        <p>

          A key measure of VC success is DPI or distributed to paid in capital and on this metric, the VC funds in the
          region have
          low DPIs and large gaps between portfolio value of the Fund vs its realized DPI. This is primarily due to long
          gestation
          period for start ups to reach stable business models, immature capital markets, scarce M&A exits and paucity
          of
          secondary funds that can bridge the final stage gap in the company’s journey.

        </p>
        <p>

          Limited Partners that have patiently backed the VC funds require returns from their earlier investments to
          reinvest in
          the industry and to meet their ongoing operating obligations. There is increasing alignment between Limited
          Partners and
          Fund managers to increase the pace of capital distribution for the overall health and balance of the industry.

        </p>
        In addition to VC funds, the other key shareholders in start ups include Founders and employees, public market
        investors, corporates, family offices and the like.

        The India and SEA Secondaries Opportunity is estimated at over $100 Billion and growing at over 25% annually.

        </div><!-- End Section Title -->

        <div class="container">

          <p>

            We invest primarily in late stage, venture backed companies in India and Southeast Asia typically 2-3 years
            to
            IPO, via
            secondary purchases from existing shareholders.
          </p>

          <p>

            Our typical target investment size $20-30M investment per company, with flexibility to do larger amounts
            through
            co-investments with our limited partners

          </p>
          <p>

            Our focus is to invest in venture backed companies with the following characteristics:

          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Evidence of business and financial maturity</li>
            <li>Strong leadership team</li>
            <li>Minimal dilution from subsequent private raises</li>
            <li>Cap table in need of liquidity solutions</li>
            <li>Up to 3 years to IPO</li>

                <span>Doing IPO was a very important milestone for us to unlock value for all our shareholders. However
                  as founders, it was
                  not something that Nami or I had ever done before. We leaned heavily on Piyush to assist us with this
                  as a key trusted
                  partner. He helped us pick our IPO banks and stayed involved on a day-to-day basis across major
                  workstreams including
                  the Analyst Presentation, prospectus drafting, investor targeting, price setting and allocations. He
                  has been our wise
                  counsel even after the IPO. He gained our trust from his high subject-matter competency - he was able
                  to see things from
                  our company’s perspective and we saw him wanting the best outcome for us. We would highly recommend
                  other founders to
                  work with him on their IPO journey and gain from his experience.

                  brings to table is quite diversified. At CarDekho, I have always been able to seek him out to access
                  the same. Before
                  investor meetings I would always call upon him to take feedback on my pitch, and pointers on the
                  investors I was going
                  to meet. The inputs came very handy to sharpen my own thought process. He is one guy you can trust and

                  helped Pine Labs thru capital raising and M&A activity. He played a significant role in the $1.1B fund
                  raise that the
                  company did in a span of 18 months. He has played the role of a prudent board member helping us

                  domain related programs. But his best contribution has been in helping me personally to bounce of

                  which can solve for growth related requirements. In his time with Pine Labs the company has grown

                <strong>Security and Fraud Awareness</strong>
                While we maintain necessary cybersecurity measures, cyber criminals may seek to impersonate or claim
                affiliation with us
                and create fraudulent websites, email domains, applications, and social media accounts. Fraudsters may
                pose as
                legitimate organizations and send emails or make phone calls to extract personal data that can be
                manipulated for the
                use of financial crimes. These scams are complex as the perpetrators may use real employee names and
                replicate
                proprietary documentation. We encourage users to be aware of the different types of fraud and to
                exercise caution when
                disclosing personal information.

                  These terms set
                  forth the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
                  all prior
                  agreements relating to such subject matter. All individuals and entities affiliated to Kenro are
                  intended third-party
                  beneficiaries of these terms. Our rights under these terms may be waived by us only in writing. These
                  terms are binding
                  on you as well as your successors and permitted assigns. In the event any provision of these terms is
                  determined to be
                  invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed severed from the remainder of these terms and
                  replaced with a
                  valid and enforceable provision as similar in intent as reasonably possible to the provision so
                  severed,
                  and shall not
                  cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of these terms.

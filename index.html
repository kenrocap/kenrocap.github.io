            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Piyush spent 17 years in technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank, Piyush had a
              deep
              understanding of technology companies and various exit mechanisms such as IPOs, M&A and Direct
              Secondaries.

            <p>
              Continuing in this role as Head of Strategic Development at region’s largest VC firm, Sequoia India/ Peak
              XV for over 7
              years, he saw the growing disparity between the growth of primary investments in venture capital in India
              and SEA vs the
              monetization of their stakes even well into the maturity stage of the company. With M&A exits scarce, the
              IPO bar high
              and a paucity of focused secondary funds, he came out of Peak XV to launch the direct secondaries strategy
              under Kenro
              Capital.

        <p>
          Secondaries investing opportunity is a derivative of the primary investment category. Venture capital went
          mainstream in
          India in mid 2000’s and has developed strongly over the last 20 years. In the 10 years between 2008 and 2017,
          based on
          PitchBook and Tracxn data, an estimated $60B+ was invested in venture capital across India and Southeast Asia
          at
          an
          annual average of $6B. Both entrepreneurship and number of VC funds grew in tandem explosively after and
          between
          2018
          and 2024, an additional $200B was invested, at an annual average of $35B.
        </p>
        <p>

          A key measure of VC success is DPI or distributed to paid in capital and on this metric, the VC funds in the
          region have
          low DPIs and large gaps between portfolio value of the Fund vs its realized DPI. This is primarily due to long
          gestation
          period for start ups to reach stable business models, immature capital markets, scarce M&A exits and paucity
          of
          secondary funds that can bridge the final stage gap in the company’s journey.

        </p>
        <p>

          Limited Partners that have patiently backed the VC funds require returns from their earlier investments to
          reinvest in
          the industry and to meet their ongoing operating obligations. There is increasing alignment between Limited
          Partners and
          Fund managers to increase the pace of capital distribution for the overall health and balance of the industry.

        </p>
        In addition to VC funds, the other key shareholders in start ups include Founders and employees, public market
        investors, corporates, family offices and the like.

        The India and SEA Secondaries Opportunity is estimated at over $100 Billion and growing at over 25% annually.

                <span>Doing IPO was a very important milestone for us to unlock value for all our shareholders. However
                  as founders, it was
                  not something that Nami or I had ever done before. We leaned heavily on Piyush to assist us with this
                  as a key trusted
                  partner. He helped us pick our IPO banks and stayed involved on a day-to-day basis across major
                  workstreams including
                  the Analyst Presentation, prospectus drafting, investor targeting, price setting and allocations. He
                  has been our wise
                  counsel even after the IPO. He gained our trust from his high subject-matter competency - he was able
                  to see things from
                  our company’s perspective and we saw him wanting the best outcome for us. We would highly recommend
                  other founders to
                  work with him on their IPO journey and gain from his experience.

                  acumen and genuine
                  intent to help. He would speak in interest of the Company vs optimising for own financial gain. The
                  investor network he
                  brings to table is quite diversified. At CarDekho, I have always been able to seek him out to access
                  the same. Before
                  investor meetings I would always call upon him to take feedback on my pitch, and pointers on the
                  investors I was going
                  to meet. The inputs came very handy to sharpen my own thought process. He is one guy you can trust and

                  domain related programs. But his best contribution has been in helping me personally to bounce of

                  which can solve for growth related requirements. In his time with Pine Labs the company has grown

                <span>During our fund raise, IPO path planning and M&A evaluations, Piyush consistently demonstrated
                  exceptional insight,

                  any time, his

                <span>Piyush has not only played a pivotal role in raising capital for HealthKart during growth journey,
                  but also helped
                  founder build perspective on capital raising and exit roadmap of the company. Piyush cut through the
                  chase and helped us
                  channelize our fundraising efforts towards right set of investors with right messaging in order to
                  drive timely closure,
                  which is most critical from founder's perspective. While at times, investors and company may have
                  conflicted interests,
                  but Piyush can be blindly trusted to provide the best advise for the company. I would always be
                  thankful to Piyush for
                  his contributions towards HealthKart journey!

                <span>Piyush has been an instrumental partner as part of Carousell’s growth journey over the years. He
                  first worked closely
                  with us in 2018 where we successfully raised US$85 million in our Series C round. Subsequently, Piyush
                  was a close
                  advisor to our team when we executed a regional M&A strategy to consolidate the region – we had
                  acquired OLX Philippines
                  from Naspers Group, Mudah Malaysia and Cho Tot Vietnam from Telenor, while simultaneously receiving
                  investments from
                  their parent companies. Due to a combination of Piyush’ financial expertise and the professional &
                  sincere way he
                  approaches these situations, Piyush is a trusted advisor for me and my team

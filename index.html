                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Piyush headed Strategic Development for India and SEA’s largest VC firm, Sequoia India (and now
                        known as Peak XV) for the last 7 years, where he saw first-hand a growing need for liquidity
                        options for a rising wave of maturing VC primary investments. With scarce M&A exits, a high bar
                        for a company to conduct an IPO and a severe paucity of focused secondary funds, he stepped out
                        of Peak XV to launch the growth stage and direct secondaries focused strategy under Kenro
                        Capital.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prior to this, Piyush spent 17 years in technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley and
                        Deutsche Bank, including as Head of Asia TMT, where he developed a deep understanding of tech
                        businesses, while executing IPOs, M&A and private placement for them.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Piyush is teaming up with a seasoned India investor with over 17 years’ experience including
                        formative years at a blue chip Sovereign Wealth Fund (or SWF) and an industry pioneer in
                        establishing the secondaries market in India, and the two have known each other for years in
                        their respective roles.

                The VC industry in India & SEA has grown from average annual investment value of $6B over 2008 to 2017,
                to
                $35B average annual investment value over 2018 to 2024, representing $260B in total investment value to
                date.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, most regional VC funds’ distributions to their Limited Partners have failed to keep pace with
                their
                portfolio value growth, driven by a combination of long business maturation, still-maturing capital
                markets,
                scarce M&A exits and a paucity of dedicated secondary funds.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the VC industry matures, there is a growing awareness and alignment between key stakeholders to
                prioritize the pace of capital distribution via several means, including direct secondary sales and
                portfolio secondary sale solutions.

                                Conducting an IPO was a very important milestone for us to unlock value for all our shareholders.
                                However as founders, it was not something that Nami or I had ever done before.
                                <strong>We leaned heavily on Piyush to assist us with this as a key trusted partner.</strong>
                                He helped us pick our IPO banks and stayed involved on a day-to-day basis across major workstreams
                                including the analyst presentation, prospectus drafting, investor targeting, price setting and allocations.
                                <strong>He has been our wise counsel even after the IPO. He gained our trust from his high subject-matter competency</strong>
                                - he was able to see things from our company’s perspective
                                and we saw him wanting the best outcome for us. We would highly recommend
                                other founders to work with him on their IPO journey and gain from his experience.

                                I have seen him in action bringing his investment banking expertise with great empathy for Founders
                                and that’s what why, he has built a solid reputation in the Founder community and <strong>he will be a go-to for many of us,

                                The investor network he brings to table is quite diversified which I sought from him for CarDekho.
                                Before my investor meetings, I would call him to take feedback on my pitch, and pointers on the investors
                                I was going to meet. The inputs came very handy to sharpen my own thought process. <strong>He is one guy you can trust

                            <strong>Security and Fraud Awareness</strong>
                            While we maintain necessary cybersecurity measures, cyber criminals may seek to impersonate
                            or claim
                            affiliation with us
                            and create fraudulent websites, email domains, applications, and social media accounts.
                            Fraudsters may
                            pose as
                            legitimate organizations and send emails or make phone calls to extract personal data that
                            can be
                            manipulated for the
                            use of financial crimes. These scams are complex as the perpetrators may use real employee
                            names and
                            replicate
                            proprietary documentation. We encourage users to be aware of the different types of fraud

                            exercise caution when
